<p>The chronology of Delphi in the Hellenistic Period is a notorious chaos.</p>

<h2 id="months-in-delphi">Months in Delphi</h2>

<p>The names and order of months at Delphi are relatively clear: it is a normal lunisolar year, beginning on the first new moon after the summer solstice (22 or 23 June).</p>

<p>| Order | Month Name | Tian-gan | Gregorian months (mostly) |
| – | – | – | – |
| 1 | Apellaios | 午 | July |
| 2 | Boucatios | 未 | August |
<!--- month of Pythia --->
| 3 | Boathoos | 申 | September |
| 4 | Heraios | 酉 | October |</p>

  <li>my name is Wang Banban. It’s written as 王班班 in its original script.
Wang is the family name and Banban is the given name.</li>
  <li>If you like, BanBan, Ban-Ban are both okay.</li>
  <li>I use “WBB” as my initials.</li>
  <li>Don’t ever write “B. Wang”, as my student card in Leiden did! I hate it!</li>
  <li>I’m fine if it’s not reversible, but I’d be glad if it’s in the correct order.</li>
  <li>Banban can mean “in order”, though it’s the result of a beautiful coincidence, see below.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>Hey dear visitors, what’s in your name?
Name is perhaps one of the first gifts you received in the world.
Maybe your parents give you a name from one of their models, their relatives, their patrons, or their best wishes.
There are harmful names as well.
A girl can be called “Zhaodi” 招弟 (i.e. “requesting a younger brother”) due to <a href="https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006663">strong misogynic traditions</a>;
or she can be called “Ya’nan” 亞男 (i.e. “second to a male” or “equal to a male”) because the family desperately want a boy.
Everyone has their story about the name, and many of us also have a <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/say-my-name-say-my-name-or-at-least-try-dammit_b_59c512abe4b08d66155041d4">Starbucks name</a> partly because some of the society think <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/personal-history/america-ruined-my-name-for-me">our names are odd</a>.
For those who don’t know, there can be quite much meaning in a name, in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7C62wFXybl0">Chinese</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdSACFmmIyU">Vietnamese</a>, and others.</p>

<p>But what about my name? Ah that’s a long story to tell, and many parts are, of course, second-hand.</p>

<p>I was born in a cold January in Guangzhou, very south in China.
My parents share the same surnames, as Wang is a super common surname, just like Müller in Germany and Nguyễn in Vietnam, and they don’t change surnames after a woman is married.
I was then lucky to have escaped from a quarrel on using whose surname (which is important in current feminist discussions!).</p>

<p>Then, give me what name?
As they didn’t know my gender yet, many of the names were designed to be okay for both boys and girls (they didn’t think of gender fluidity though)
It seems my paternal grandfather didn’t care that much, as I’m not his first grandchild.
My father was active in the Cultural Revolution, urged the family to call me “Zeya” 澤亞 (i.e., bringing grace to Asia), as (1) an hommage to Mao Zedong (bringing grace to the East); and (2) following the trend of mentioning Asia after 1990 Asian Games in Beijing.
My maternal grandpa or <em>Laoye</em> was lovely.
He suggested a name “Chunyi” 春依, which can both mean “leaning on the spring” and “what the spring (春 Chun) leans on” (his name has 春).
This sounds a really good name and when I still had the idea of having a child I’d have loved to name them this.</p>

<p>But it seems my mom had the last say.
At the thirty-third week she dreamt of a name, in which the two “Wang” 王 characters were connected with a heart (忄).
She wrote it down and here came “Banban” 班班.</p>

<p>Notice the difference?
Yes, there’re two dots in the character for heart, but only one for the thing between two “Wang”s.
The latter, in fact, is derived from “knife” 刀 !
In this way, Banban actually cut up the two Wang’s, not that anyone would know …</p>

<p>Anyways, Banban brings me luck and troubles.
A reduplicative name (or “ABB”) is usually taken as <a href="https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=23204">diminuitive or feminine</a>, so questions like “what’s your real name?” or “are you a girl or a boy?” came frequently in my childhood. And who could have known that many <a href="https://chinadigitaltimes.net/chinese/388974.html">Communist princelings</a> are given reduplicative names, including Bo Guagua, Li Tete?
It causes me problems in Chinese-speaking area and I really thought of changing my name.
Wang Banban is easy in writing and especially in cursive.
Many then read my cursive signature as “2 212 212”, very easy :)</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="life" /><category term="life" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[and its story]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Letters in Greek epigraphic landscape</title><link href="https://wangbanban17.github.io//blog/2023/gent/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Letters in Greek epigraphic landscape" /><published>2023-06-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-06-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://wangbanban17.github.io//blog/2023/Gent</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://wangbanban17.github.io//blog/2023/gent/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Goedemorgen !
It’s my great pleasure to come back to Gent and also to participate in this great workshop, meet some old friends and talk about late antiquity.
I thank <a href="https://research.flw.ugent.be/en/lieve.vanhoof">Lieve</a>, <a href="https://research.flw.ugent.be/en/marijke.kooijman">Marijke</a> and <a href="https://research.flw.ugent.be/en/matthijs.zoeter">Matthijs</a> for the organisation and it’s so nice to meet you all, especially after the tough COVID time which we all went through.
My talk today is a preliminary attempt to bring some methods from earlier periods and different areas to late antique epigraphy, especially Greek epigraphy.
At the same time, I hope to see what a <em>longue durée</em> perspective on late-antique public documents can help us understand civic mechanism in Greek cities, especially larger cities in developing a landscape of inscriptions.
My talk will be in three parts: first, a brief overview of the concept »Epigraphic landscape«; second, a thematic analysis on letters as a genre in epigraphic landscape; last part is about the exemplary case Ephesos.</p>

<h2 id="epigraphic-landscape">Epigraphic Landscape</h2>

<p>Many Hellenistic and Roman cities in the Hellenophone were covered with a textile full of inscriptions.
While epigraphic practice declined to a certain extent starting from the third century onwards, the presence of inscriptions (old and new) are still everywhere in late antique cities, even though new public texts were mostly found in large metropoleis.
It is against this background that epigraphers in the last decades talked more, in an archaeological glance, on the concept of <em>epigraphic landscape</em>.<d-footnote>On this topic, a good glance on the research stand is Ruiz (2013) on Roman epigraphy.rch project [Epigraphic Landscape of Athens](http://epigraphiclandscape.unito.it/index.php).<d-cite key="lasagniTropea2019Paesaggio"></d-cite></d-footnote></p>

<p>Studies on the epigraphic landscape focus much on cities with a rich monumental and epigraphic presence: Athens, many well-excavated cities in the Latinophone west, Rome, and my dissertation on Hellenistic Delphi.
Although archaeological evidence is less well preserved than earlier times, partly because of the frequent reuse of monumental and architectural blocks, in cities like Ephesos and Corinth ans cities in n africa it is still possible to read stones in landscape.
Such studies take a diachronic view of inscribing practice and examine how viewers in their own times could view, understand, and interact with inscribed artefacts (walls, steles, etc.) within its environments.
And reuse or continuity of inscribing play clearly a role in this diachronic development of epigraphic practice.</p>

<p>It is important to ask the question how viewers saw inscribed documents, both those inscribed in their time and in earlier times, as part of the city landscape.
Also, we may wonder, when a new text was inscribed somewhere in a city, how did the landscape change or if it changed.
To answer this question, we need to identify both the nature of the inscription-bearers (<em>Schriftträger</em>) and the view in a given time, in our case, late antiquity, in order to give proper interpretations.
It is also crucial to understand inscriptions in types, and see how different types of texts were displayed and engaged with: my studies on manumission acts and honorific landscape in Hellenistic Delphi as an example, and today I’m talking about administrative letters.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="administrative-letters-as-a-type">Administrative letters as a type</h2>

<p>Speaking of administrative letters, I guess we have already been challenged or been inspired by Corcocan and Grünbart on their definitions and scales.
In the Hellenistic periods it has been a long tradition to study ‘Royal Correspondences’, and these letters were commonly found with nice archaeological landscape records, enabling us to further explore the visual context of them.<d-footnote>The basis is Welles' important collection <i>Royal Correspondence</i>, but also later researches, including Bencivenni 2011. See also the idea of 'statuescape' from Ma 2011.</d-footnote>
During the Principate, especially in provincial metropoleis, imperial decrees granting privileges and honours are frequently found in the agora, in the gymnasium, and sometimes also in sanctuaries that are related to the imperial cult, as a symbol of oligarchisation of cities, already having started in the late Hellenistic period.
Starting from the emergence of Hellenistic epigraphic culture in the third century BC till its decline in the third century CE, administrative letters enjoyed a special privilege in the epigraphic landscape of Greek cities, especially large cities.<d-footnote>To this, the best regional study is still Rizakis on the Hellenistic and Roman Peloponnese.</d-footnote></p>

<p>A continuity of this practice cannot be verified for the period we are concerning today, Late Antiquity, as most of the sources we have are in ‘fragmentary nature’ or we are ‘lack of knowledge about their original location’ (in Corcoran’s words).<d-footnote>Corcoran 2018, 5.</d-footnote>
Does this mean we cannot say anything about the landscape of late-antique letters? My answer is partly we still can.
This is because we understand late antique epigraphy not as an independent period but with a comparative eye from its earlier time.</p>

<p>There are some basic info we still need to get us on the same page.
While in the Hellenistic Royal Correspondences collections, Greece mainland and Asia Minor divide a share of 4/6, in late antiquity the percentage is very unbalanced.
In the 132 entries we collect in the East from Diocletian to Markianos,<d-footnote>so the sources are mainly Feissel 2009, minus the latinophone west but plus those multi-copied entries and the Diocletian decrees. I'll put this on my website after the talk.</d-footnote> findspots came to a number of 61, namely on average one city has roughly more than two texts.
In fact, only nine cities have more than one text, because 29 entries are from Ephesos.<br />
The largely unproportional geodistribution of sources resulted in the lack of epigraphic dossiers in multiple cities:
apart from the reinscribed dossier in Aphrodisias and the letters in Mylasa, most dossiers in the late-antique cities are chained texts rather than individual texts inscribed on an artefact, be it stele or temple wall. \</p>

<p>This leads to the big question on all kinds of administrative inscriptions: are inscribed letters to be read in their times or later times?
WHile administrative letters have practical roles, the practice of inscribing them brought them into the field of rulership or »Herrschaftsschrifttum«.
This was already much of the case in the Hellenistic times and more in the Principate, but it came to a peak in late-antique inscribed artefacts.
We don’t find any ‘publication clause’ as did in earlier letter inscriptions, some of the edicts that ruled how to display texts are about who paid for inscribing.
In this sense, inscribing by itself ceased to become a self-evident element for administrative letters, and epigraphic presence of an administrative letter which could have just been left in the city archive shows more univocal and unidirectional power, even if the letter(s) consist(s) of a corresponding sequence of letters.</p>

<p>Denis Feissel and Simon Corcoran have discussed much on the publication process and rendered the authority to make decision of publication to the high power, while the petitioners are responsible for their display.<d-footnote>Feissel 34–5, Corcoran 2018, 9 pointing to *AE* 1997, 1443.</d-footnote>
This explains partly why we find clauses similar to earlier ‘publication clauses’ not on stone, but in <em>Novelle</em> 8 and other literary sources. <d-footnote>The only exception we have in epigraphic sources is not *per se* an integral instruction of publication, but the rule about who should fund the inscription.</d-footnote>
I am fully with Feissel and Corcoran here.
What I want to add is that the local society better knows how to engage the audience if the texts are designed to have an audience: the location, the language and the script are all about this.
Just as German texts in modern Hellenic kingdom brought the sense of power, better or worse, the Latin letters and the script contain the sense of authority and authenticity in various levels and cannot be discussed here.
About the landscape, a topographic knowledge correspond to the local epigraphic habit: as in today, protestors in Heidelberg know where to put posters will get the largest expected readership.</p>

<p>In Mylasa, long after the decline of the imperial cult, the area of the temple of Augustus and Roma was still active thanks to the very recent archaeological evidence.
The long podium wall of the imperial temple enables the local authority to fulfill the request by the praetorian prefect (<em>I.Mylasa</em> 613) to inscribe the letters of Theodosius II and his <em>comes sacrarum largitionum</em> in 427 CE in every Carian city.
It was already since Hekatomid dynasty, so earlier than third century BCE that Carians have the tradition to inscribe administrative documents on the wall of temples. And this is a local practice as people in the hellenophone world don’t do that everywhere, especially in Greece mainland.
Here, the inscription was written in one column that takes 4,5 metres long on the wall, something Hellenistic and Roman practice don’t really see.
A visitor will easily see the large dedicatory text on the architrave of the temple for Augustus and Roma goddess in Greek, but when walking alongside the temple back and forth, he will have to take care of the crazily long imperial rescript if he wants to read them, a bit lower than his eye level</p>

<p>Similarly, Aphrodisias’ so-called ‘Archival wall’ was also understood in a way that not only local citizens but visitors to the performance will have to go past.
A current visitor with nice camera will be easily able to take perfect photos with readable texts, as the later Christian readers took pains to find all the words for Aphrodite and sometimes, Augustus and erase them during the turmoil between Christians and pagans.</p>

<p>(An astonishing parallel was found on the other end of the Eurasia when a Chinese imperial rescript in 711 CE certifying the privilege of a Taoist temple ruled that a bronze bell be casted and the inscription was put in the bell with unreadable scripts made by the emperor.
By ringing the bell as part of the ritual, the priests are literally hitting on the imperial rescript while reassuring the power of this inscribed artefact. And its presence on the bell itself brought the Herrschaft.)</p>

<hr />

<p>Speaking of inscribed artefacts having power, it is also interesting to notice how people living in the fourth to the sixth century coped with letters already there before them.
Reinterpretation of old inscribed administrative documents influenced the reusing process of temples and constructions in the late-antique period.
Many of the small cities in the late antique period did not have further expansion and those old letters are thus simply ignored. We therefore luckily have many Hellenistic and early Roman letters in Thessaly, in Cilicia, and in Priene where late-antique buildings didn’t use old materials.
Sometimes the stones were still taken elsewhere for reuse, but this is merely about its material value of being stone.
There seems to have been a certain valid period when a certain imperial inscription can be taken up for reuse, but this needs further studies if it’s possible at all. 
On the right we have IK Eph. 41, a letter of Constance II to proconsul of Asia in around 351, which was found in the pavement of Embolos persumably either after the restoration of the city mentioned in the Eutropius letter by Valens in 371, or the large restoration of the city in the fifth century according to material evidence.
In Thessaloniki, both the imperial rescript for Saint Demetrios and the prefect’s order were integrated into the north wall of the church, at least one hundred years later than they were inscribed. 
We have mentioned the practice of erasure, not only as part of damnatio memoriae, but also the continuous inscribing, as the inscription with Julian’s name erased in Aphrodisias will later receive the name of Valens on top of the erasure space!
There are cases where old letters were preserved in late antiquity, though apart from the practice in Ankyra namely the <em>res gestae</em> of Augustus, I can’t see if I can come up with a good argumentation flow to identify a case for preservation.
And also, as were the case in late Hellenistic times, cities also re-inscribe texts that they received logn time ago in a new circumstance for new reason: Aphrodisias’ archival wall was a comparable case to Attalos’ dossier in Panormos, both a century later than the original the text dossier was inscribed in a meaningful layout for a new reason. 
What I think it needs further thinking is to take the perspective of reading and do an archaeology for it.
Whether our sources are enough is another question.</p>

<p>Not only were the texts read but more importantly, monuments were read as well by new people.
and we are able to infer how they read monuments through how they put new texts on old monuments.
This practice, which I call »Weiterbeschriftung« and perhaps »continue-inscribing« (in english? please make new suggestions!) is a crucial part both for my talk today and my dissertation in the Hellenistic Delphi.
It uses the affordable space of an already existing monument, inscribed or uninscribed alike.
In the dossier of scribo in Hadrianopolis in Honoriade, the new, sixth century scribe John has his very plainly administrative letters warning the bandit local elites onto an honorific statue for Commodus, which stood on a wide road in the archaeological context.
We have already seen the Orcistos example in Simon Corcoran’s talk, where the front side of the pillar base was the beginning of the text and then the right, the left at the end.
Here in Hadrianopolis, you have to walk around the base line by line as it was inscribed continuously from the right face to the left face, thinking about Mylasa! And to this I need help from papyrologists :)
Another intriguing though uncommon practice is found in Sardeis, where a late antique governor’s edict was inscribed directly on a non-erased letter preamble from Septimius Severus.
As far as I know only one case in early third century Delphi, the Siphnian Treasury where an administrative letter from the civic authority was inscribed palimpsestically on an earlier honorific decree, but please inform me if you know more cases.
Here, the IMP CAES was left out and not covered, and Harriet Flower’s argument that the imperial titulars carry the authority may stand here. 
In Justinianopolis namely Didyma, we encounter a case where an uninscribed block was taken as inscription-bearer for the famous dossier recording the transmission of message. The block from the second century CE was originally a wide orthostate, but when in the sixth century the stonecutter took a 90° rotation and use its width as height for embedding the long dossier (Feissel, <em>Chiron</em> 2004). 
This practice we call Weiterbeschriftung but not continuous-inscribing though.
And the last example on this slide, this Athenian stele recording the Caesariani dossier, was on a typical Athenian material for important administrative documents in the very early times, but here the surface was not polished first, and thus out of the epigraphic landscape in Athenian administrative documents. It is possible, I guess, that the stone itself was also reused from somewhere else as Athenians ceased to inscribe documents on such kind of stele shapes in the middle of the Principate, (but I have to verify this when I travel to Athens this November…)</p>

<hr />

<p>A Zwischenfazit:
the artefacts bearing inscribed administrative letters in late antiquity were standing between the practicality of their material and the power or authority granted to them.
The reading and, depending on reading, the reusage of these artefacts were also standing between a pure (practical) materialism and a strong (intentional or even ideological) capture as <em>spolia</em>.
While we don’t always have the ideal <em>Standort</em> <em>Fundort</em> patterns for these late-antique letter inscriptions, to study how they were read makes us to better understand both how imperial power was perceived and how ‘unsacred’ their artefacts were.</p>

<p>(You may have noticed that I avoid talking about Ephesos much till now, as it’s the third part because it has richest sources both in the practice of reuse and in the practice of inscribing thanks to the archaeological documentations. And this is certainly a continuation of Feissel’s 1999 article but focussing more on the practice of later usage.
Whether Ephesos shall be an exception, or we can learn from Ephesos some larger mechanisms, will be a question for us all. )
Now, let the fragments talk in Ephesos.</p>

<h2 id="ephesos-cumulative-texts-in-a-changing-landscape">Ephesos. cumulative texts in a changing landscape</h2>

<p>Thanks both to its metropolitan status in <em>Provincia Asiae</em> and to the long and detailed excavations, Ephesos was an unescapable case on any serious discussion about public epigraphy in the late antique East, just like Delphi in the Hellenistic times.</p>

<p>Inscribed administrative letters in Ephesos are found in many places in the city, already in the Hellenistic Period; and they were reused in different earlier times: one letter from Attalos II king of Pergamon who appointed a teacher from Ephesos for his son, later Attalos III, was inscribed on a wide block which serves perfectly as a pillar base or top.
The block was then reused in a pillar from the inner hall of the Agora.
Statues with Ptolemais, Attalos, and Antiochos of Commagene were taken, normally from the Agora, to the Domitian temple, to the harbour, and to private houses in the second century (the date according to archaeologists focussing on Embolos).
And the practice of reuse, especially in High Empire and sometimes in Late Antiquity, was attested for around half of the Hellenistic inscriptions in Ephesos (not many though) and almost every case not in the Artemision.
A Roman <em>Senatus consultum</em> was found in Artemision, and may have escaped from reuse as it was far from the city.</p>

<p>In the high empire, emperors and governors continue to write letters and they make much on steles and sometimes also on slabs for buildings, mostly on the Embolos and in the Theatre.
And reuse or de-re-localisation appear in short and long terms: fragments for IEph 19b was found at the Magnesian Gate but the bulk of the text in the theatre, as an example.
The Caesariani dossier copy in Ephesos have four fragments, two from the west and south pillars of the Agora, one in the Hanghaus II where we also find a statue for Ptolemais II and Arsinoe, and the last from the theatre.
The practice that reusing letter blocks in fragmentary nature was done clearly in late-antique times, together with other kinds of inscriptions told us a sad story that, for those later building projects, inscribed imperial letters were not that important, though those letters themselves, we don’t know.</p>

<p>One of the best preserved cases with its landscape was found at the Octagon, a monument built in the Early Empire with possible Hellenistic basis and material (a new study said in the Augustan Period based on stratigraphy, I’m not 100% following but okay, definitely Early Empire but not Hadrianic, as earlier scholars argue).
In front of the Octagon which was designed for a underground grave, there were high slabs or socles to cover the entrance of the grave house: by cover I mean the passage between the slabs and the entrance was thin.
And it’s clear those slabs only became inscription-bearers in late antiquity when two rescripts from Valens, in different periods for two different proconsuls, were inscribed <em>together</em> on six socles here, in column!
The first, in 371 to Eutropius on the civic revenues, was purely in Latin, and the second to Festus a later proconsul but in five years about the contests in the provincia Asiae, was in Latin original and a local Greek translation. Two texts were written in very similar hands (and I beg you to believe me or to believe in André Chastagnol).
While both rescripts are famous to many of you, it strikes me why, while they were inscribed together and perhaps from the same commission, only one has a Greek translation and the other in Latin?
A possible interpretation, and I don’t agree with Chastagnol here, is that the local Greek trans. was for visitors, especially those elites from other cities in <em>provincia</em> to alarm them, don’t run your own contest but stay in the provincial games.
It may be due to this that they found the slabs in front of the Octagon, very prominent in location and not inscribed.
So we meet the phenomenon of Weiterbeschriftung, the language problem, and the local landscape of inscriptions and then I ask the question who was in charge of this writing? I would give more weight to the Ephesian community than to Festus here.</p>

<p>The last slide is about church documents.
We know there are two main churches in Ephesos in the sixth century: one is St. John, for which Justinian wrote a honorific letter that was found on the Agora door! Also about St. John Justinian showed his preference over Smyrna’s Polycarp in a letter <em>IK</em> I 45, but the text was reused in a pavement of the Domitian Piaza. 
This may have to do with the fact that St. John was beyond the city area and display of this honour was for the city rather than for the church itself. 
The other is famous for holding the two Ephesian council and the Austrians sometimes call it Konzilskirche but it’s the city’s cathedral St. Mary.
We find from here six letters in Feissel’s catalogue, all about ecclesiastical affairs, and perhaps from a single dossier owned by bishop Hypatios. We have here a Justinian’s fragmentary rescript, another letter which we wait for Feissel’s edition, an arbitrary letter between St. Mary and St. John, and very interestingly, a pastoral letter by himself to the city of Ephesos.
These texts were found everywhere in St. Mary as a living church for long time, but must have been in a certain place before they were reused in tombs within the church or in the narthex, or in the baptistery, or in the front courtyard. 
This further blurrs the division of epigraphic practice between ‘ecclesiastical’ and ‘secular’ documents, as this dossier, from the promulgation to the collection and the reuse, are just so common as we see in other areas in Ephesos.
It does occupies a special landscape in the city, but occupies in a way as other Ephesian texts did!</p>

<p>看到這本標題爲《Stalin and the Fate of Europe: The Postwar Struggle for Sovereignty》的書，我的第一反應是：「啊，檔案基礎上的大國博弈和獨裁者心理分析麼？不過是一位著名學者的作品呢。」翻到題記竟是經常被當作「民粹式史學家」的 Taylor 的這句話，纔覺並非如此簡單。身處東亞的我們或許比較清楚，第二次世界大戰之後又過了十數年，新的政治秩序方逐漸穩定下來：國共戰爭、朝鮮戰爭、印度支那戰爭甚至七十年代的越南戰爭，都是二戰後重劃東亞政治版圖的集中體現。第二次世界大戰在世界上的很多地方，都不過是一連串戰爭中相對較大的一場，在一些地方（比如西亞）甚至不如後來更嚴重的戰爭。但在歐洲，敘事似乎很簡單和粗線條：在柏林被攻克後，似乎就衹有華盛頓和莫斯科不斷瓜分歐洲的勢力範圍，最終鐵幕降下，歐洲分裂成東西兩大陣營。走過歐洲各國的博物館，對二戰結束到冷戰開始的這段時間描述往往集中在如何重建家園、如何審判納粹和國內內奸、如何重建國家主權或者被（主要是蘇聯）霸權國家操控。這種表達大概不能算是完全離譜，但也是極大簡化了問題。美蘇在歐洲不同地區投入的精力相當不平衡。具體到每一個國家，站在 1945 年，它們的命運未必是註定的；整個歐洲也未必一定會走向分裂和冷戰。我們現在看待這段時間的角度，很大程度上是因爲我們天然被「劇透」了。</p>

<p>而身爲美國人的作者奈馬克，希望提醒讀者（當然首先是美國讀者）注意更重要的三個要素：史達林的個人政策、歐洲人的主動性和即將到來的冷戰。爲此，他選擇了七個地區不同、背景不同、發展方向及結果亦不相同的案例，試圖呈現這三個要素在各種案例中的多樣性以及彼此拉鋸的過程。按作者原話：</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They demonstrate that postwar Europe was in a state of flux: Allied armies evacuated occupied territories; alliances were redefined; local politics mattered. Elections were crucial and political leadership meant a lot. [24]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>考慮到奈馬克的方法論，我認爲對本書的評價不可避免地要回到對這七個案例的細緻討論中，看作者是否在史料允許的情況下，確實證明了史達林並無既定不變的方針，是否充分表現了歐洲各國的能動性，是否足夠聯繫起更大局勢和後來發展。</p>

<hr />

<p>下面展開討論這七個案例：</p>

<p>1. 丹麥•博爾赫姆島（1945-6），這座島嶼因其介於瑞典、德國、波蘭之間的波羅的海出口位置，戰略地位很早就被蘇聯重視。二戰結束前蘇軍對該島大舉進攻，試圖讓島上德軍降蘇以便長期控制。但經過丹麥與蘇聯的談判，蘇軍於 1946 年 4 月撤出該島，丹麥則與蘇聯簽訂貿易協定幫助蘇聯恢復經濟，並保證英美軍隊不得踏足該島。奈馬克主張，斯大林的目標從一開始軍事上長期控制該島，逐漸轉變爲以在島上駐軍爲威脅，要求駐在丹麥的英軍撤離。蘇軍並未試圖在該島上施行蘇聯體制或清算納粹協力者，他們雖然與當地民衆有所摩擦，但在更大程度上與當地保持着純然民事上的接觸。當地民衆與政府也並非一邊倒地反感蘇軍，甚至丹麥王儲都一度訪問該島慰問蘇聯駐軍：史達林因此得以藉此在撤軍前獲取更多道義上的和經濟上的利益。但在親蘇派失利丹麥大選、蘇軍得以控制其他交通要道的基礎上，丹麥外交力量的反覆斡旋成功說服史達林和莫洛托夫（蘇聯外長），以貿易合作換取撤軍。奈馬克看到史達林希望構建一片中立緩衝地帶的想法，而丹麥外交的努力也符合史達林的期待。</p>

<p>這一章作爲全書開頭，很大程度上試圖打破對蘇佔區的刻板印象：奈馬克的描述十分緩和，蘇軍就像是一批長期寄居但自己也不清楚要待多久的客人，在這裏和主人們跳舞喝酒。但覈查引文就會發現，作者使用史料以俄文和英文爲主，丹麥文檔案和作品則鮮有使用（或許是因爲語言限制？）。我因此雖然並不會懷疑哥本哈根政府的外交策略（因爲僅有的一本丹麥文作品是關於高層外交的，還有俄文譯本），但對當地民衆究竟如何看待這件事，卻有進一步的問題。當地民衆和知識人如何看待丹麥與德國在戰爭中的某種合作，以及當地和哥本哈根媒體如何報道蘇聯駐軍事宜，都是問題。本章結尾，奈馬克描述了島上的蘇聯紀念碑遺蹟和丹麥與俄國對島上禁止外國駐軍的「君子協定」。我也因此好奇，這些遺蹟對當地的集體記憶又有多大意義。爲什麼 90 年代以後丹麥仍然遵守著這條君子協定，而美國是否又想過打破它呢？另外，史達林在本章中很大程度上被他的外長莫洛托夫搶戲，作者有時候似乎默認著莫洛托夫的文字背後有史達林的意志，有時候又覺得莫洛托夫是以自己的方針處理外交（這點我將在之後提及）。當然本章在全書中也屬於相對較有系統的一部分。</p>

<p>2. 阿爾巴尼亞的獨立（1944-8）。二戰以後強大的南斯拉夫一直試圖將阿爾巴尼亞吸收爲自己的加盟國，以擴展自己在整個南巴爾幹的勢力範圍，而並不重視阿爾巴尼亞的史達林對此本來沒有意見。阿爾巴尼亞內部則對如何應對北方強鄰十分矛盾：南斯拉夫領袖鐵托支持的佐治（Koçi Xoxe）主張親善南斯拉夫甚至直接併入其中，以抗衡南方的資本主義希臘王國。領袖霍查（Enver Hoxha）則是民族主義者，他先尋求在南斯拉夫內同出一族的科索沃人的支持，以圖在可能統一的大南斯拉夫中謀得更大話語權；在鐵托試圖支持佐治奪權時，霍查先是訪問莫斯科，拉進自己與蘇聯的關係並隱隱傳達對鐵托的不滿，刺激史達林與鐵托的矛盾；又利用反南斯拉夫派大人物詩俾魯（Nako Spiru）之死和蘇聯駐阿爾巴尼亞專家等問題爲藉口將蘇南矛盾逐漸挑明，然後兩面用力，既維持南阿關係使得本國能有安全保障，又效忠蘇聯以防鐵托用佐治取代自己。蘇南交惡後，霍查更有了徹底切割南斯拉夫的機會：他得以成爲蘇聯在南巴爾幹的橋頭堡和可信盟友（並因此壓過了另一個南巴爾幹社會主義國家保加利亞一頭），並以「鐵托主義叛徒」的罪名處決了政敵佐治，鞏固了將持續近四十年的個人統治，並也開始了自己不斷更換依附對象的時代：霍查將在蘇共二十大後聯合毛澤東與蘇聯決裂，並在毛與美國接近時又指責毛背叛馬列主義。</p>

<p>這一章相比上一章，重要角色要更多：奈馬克花了將近一整節來講述史達林和鐵托如何逐漸走向決裂，以便讀者理解霍查如何利用二者矛盾，並腳踏兩隻船直到最終站在蘇聯一邊。但核心仍然放在史達林和霍查兩人身上。在史達林角度，奈馬克成功描繪了他從一開始輕視阿爾巴尼亞，到利用阿爾巴尼亞來抵抗鐵托的過程。霍查在本章中也有從「試圖在大南斯拉夫內爲本民族爭取更高地位」到堅決抵抗南斯拉夫的轉變。如果說要在本章中挑出最重要的問題，就是蘇聯、阿爾巴尼亞以外的史料很少。考慮到貝爾格萊德檔案在 1999 年被炸後保存不佳，我們無法苛責作者未能使用塞爾維亞的檔案；但在敘述霍查與保加利亞、希臘共產黨人的聯動一節中，卻衹有霍查的聲音，保加利亞和希臘的檔案則幾乎沒有。我可以看到本章作者頗具野心地想把霍查的運作放在整個南巴爾幹地緣政治的範疇之下，但不得不說他劃定的範圍實在太大，絕非一章可以收錄了。除此以外，本章的水平要高於上一章。</p>

<p>3. 芬蘭爭取政治獨立（1944-8）。二戰期間站在德國一邊的芬蘭，在戰後幾乎被英美放棄，似乎註定要成爲蘇聯的附庸國，而史達林也派出深受信任的日丹諾夫（Andrei Aleksandrovich Zhdanov）代表督管芬蘭，試圖在當地推行「人民民主主義」。那麼芬蘭爲何最終仍得以維持憲政民主呢？奈馬克認爲有兩個重要因素：（1）審時度勢、知道如何討好史達林的同時維持國家獨立性的「老芬蘭」（Old Finns）保守派；（2）史達林和日丹諾夫都對始終扶不起的芬蘭共產黨十分失望。在芬蘭共產黨始終無法擴大政治影響力的情況下，一直和蘇聯保持溝通的老政客巴錫基维（Juho Kusti Paasikivi）一面積極與社會民主黨合作，一面在戰犯審判、割地賠款、不參與馬歇爾計劃（Marshall Plan）等問題上向蘇聯讓步。芬蘭共產黨則既受制於蘇聯佔領軍的政策，自己也無法提升民望，在大選中節節失利。相比於將芬蘭變成社會主義國家，史達林首先考慮的是讓芬蘭無法再次威脅蘇聯（尤其是列寧格勒）。因此，在反覆談判後他認定，與蘇聯有漫長不設防邊境的芬蘭在被剝奪大片領土後已是安全的夥伴，於是順水推舟促成了盟軍與芬蘭的和平協定。就此，緊鄰蘇聯並曾被蘇聯長期駐軍的芬蘭，竟奇跡般地在一批舊政客帶領下從蘇聯人手上贏得了獨立自主。</p>

<p>這是相對單薄的一章，不僅因爲現實情勢相對簡單，牽涉人物不如前兩章多，更因爲作者幾乎沒有直接使用芬蘭方面的檔案材料：僅有的部分芬蘭史料轉引自一本芬蘭人寫的芬蘭通史。老芬蘭政客與社會民主黨之間的溝通未能充分展現，使奈馬克關於老芬蘭政客的動機猜測頗成問題。考慮到芬蘭檔案史料相對開放，這很可能又是因爲作者的語言侷限：我們當因此質疑作者爲何要選擇一個自己無法直接閱讀其語言的領域了。當然，蘇聯方面的觀點變化更清晰一些，但奈馬克似乎又沒有仔細區分哪些是史達林的觀點，哪些是日丹諾夫的，哪些又是日丹諾夫揣度史達林想法後提出的。綜合來看，本章可能更適合毫不熟悉相關史事的讀者淺嚐輒止，有意深入者敬請直接閱讀相關人物的研究。</p>

<p>4. 意大利的戰後選舉（1948）。雖然蘇聯未曾駐軍意大利，但戰後的意大利共產黨及其領袖托里亞蒂（Parmiro Togliatti）在國內威望很高，史達林因此不希望意共武裝奪取政權，而是與現政府合作並逐步將該國轉爲社會主義。本章的核心是意大利戰後，意共和基督教民主黨如何反覆調整策略，而英美和蘇聯又如何不同程度干預意大利的選舉。托里亞蒂一直壓抑黨內激進派以和基督教民主黨總理德加斯佩里（Alcido De Gasperi）合作，但後者 1947 年初訪美後堅定的親美政策和 5 月解散內閣驅除意共閣員等動作，讓意共、蘇聯和試圖在意大利獲得更多話語權的南斯拉夫，都一度籌劃武裝運動。但隨着蘇南對立，史達林又轉而支持托里亞蒂的溫和傾向，鼓勵他在 1948 年 4 月大選中聯合社民黨等中產階級和中左翼勢力，搞一場捷克斯洛伐克式的政治化紅色風潮。在捷克斯洛伐克事件後深憂意大利步其後塵的英美也大開宣傳機器，從經濟威脅到拍攝反蘇影片，再到天主教會的深度介入，甚至動用早已定居美國的意裔人士名義給意民眾寫信來影響結果。意共在大選中失利讓激進派再次籌劃武裝運動，並在托里亞蒂於同年 7 月遇刺重傷後發動大罷工，意政府也防備著可能爆發的內戰。但蘇聯反對事態進一步升級，復出政壇的托里亞蒂也迅速採取冷靜政策。意共就此再也無法在全國政治舞臺上合法奪權，而蘇聯也對西歐共產黨整體失望了。</p>

<p>這章內容很豐富，論述也很深入，也是筆者認爲最能體現本書研究方法的一章。當然這也可能是因爲這是本書第一個大量運用本地史料的章節。托里亞蒂被塑造成一位爲保證國家和平寧可犧牲黨派利益的革命者，始終利用自己的威信維持著共產黨的地位並保證激進派不致發動暴動。史達林的決策方向則很複雜：他並不喜歡托里亞蒂，但又不得不依賴後者的威望；他既希望意大利能發生捷克斯洛伐克一樣的社會主義改變，又憚於布拉格事件後英美的強硬反應，更在晚些時候擔心鐵托能借意大利武裝運動掀起更大風浪。德加斯佩里則用精妙的政治操作，一面倒向美國支持本國經濟，一面在國內利用蘇聯威脅和與托里亞蒂的良好關係謀取自己利益最大化。得益於豐富的檔案和報刊史料，奈馬克成功描述了美英、教會、基督教民主黨、意共和蘇聯等各方在不同時間的政治操作變化，並且將意大利事務與同時期的世界格局成功聯繫起來。唯一稍顯不足的是，德加斯佩里相關的材料似乎主要出自關於他的傳記，而並非直接利用檔案，是個遺憾。</p>

<p>5. 柏林封鎖（1948-9）。這是七章內容中（美國）普通讀者可能最爲熟悉的一段史事，也是奈馬克本人研究的專業領域。傳統敘述中，蘇聯軍事封鎖柏林要將崇尚自由的西柏林人餓死，而英勇的美英飛行員通過空運救助了西柏林陷入饑荒的普通德國人。而奈馬克努力強調，在傳統敘述中德國人尤其是柏林人的角色被大幅低估了，而史達林也不是鐵了心從頭開始就要餓死德國人這麼簡單。戰後蘇聯和法國希望儘量榨取德國的工業產能與資源來彌補本國戰爭期間的嚴重損失，而英美則更希望德國經濟迅速自立，以降低本國駐軍和資助的預算。對史達林來說，一個統一但在經濟政治上弱化的德國要比一個分裂但軍事經濟完全恢復的德國更符合蘇聯利益。他相信，衹要德國是中立而非完全倒向西方，蘇聯在大陸上的強大軍力就能保證德國如芬蘭一般居於中立。英美法三國佔領區的貨幣改革打碎了史達林的計劃。 他嘗試用外交手段阻止西方陣營失敗後，便逐漸開始審查東西方之間的出版品和物資往來、劫持政敵等手段，以脅迫西方就範，但當時未有封鎖進出路徑或禁飛的打算。而美軍此時就已經加強空運，預防可能的徹底封鎖；並繼續推動西德地區的議會選舉等建政舉措。史達林試圖把西方打成「分裂主義者」（splitters）、鼓吹「實現德國統一」來吸引德國民眾，但西德貨幣改革帶來的經濟成功，進一步撕裂了蘇聯與西方的差距。封鎖西柏林應被看作是蘇聯德國政策的一環，他們無意也沒有令西柏林陷入饑荒，而是因應形勢讓封鎖或松或緊，尤其是希望讓德國人和柏林人認清，誰纔是柏林的主宰。西方雖然開始了柏林空運和對蘇佔東德地區的物資禁運，但仍被迫坐到了談判桌前。</p>

<p>本章成功的部分在於呈現了上至西柏林市長洛伊特（Ernst Reuter）下至普通柏林市民對封鎖的情緒變化：奈馬克利用了不少普通人和文化人的書信和檔案，來還原當時的社會風向：他們逐漸苦於蘇聯的攔路審查、沒收西德馬克和應對抗議時的暴行，又利用東西柏林貨幣不對等，運輸東柏林高價值產品來賺取西德馬克。在蘇聯要求西柏林人「到蘇佔區註冊」以獲得生活物資補給時，已經看到英美空運的西柏林人祇有少數前去註冊，而多數則開始協助英美空軍投送物資。西柏林市長洛伊特看到英美試圖建立一個西德政府時，又擔心英美將放棄西柏林這片飛地專注於西方各邦，因而在1948 年 9 月 9 日發表了著名的「國會演說」，呼籲國際社會支持西柏林，並呼籲東西柏林市民向蘇軍示威。這種類似道德脅迫的政治舉措引來擔心蘇軍直接出兵西柏林的美軍不滿，但美軍也無法公開批評西柏林人的行為。柏林人的壓力、遭禁運的蘇佔東德面臨經濟困難、英美擔憂對立引發暴動或戰爭，多方力量最終推動莫斯科和華盛頓磋商化解危機。而史達林的觀點變化脈絡，在全章則並不清晰。奈馬克或許是發現自己的敘述主線略顯破碎，於是在本章結語中重新勾勒了史達林對西柏林和西德民衆心理的多次誤讀，這倒是很值得今日的讀者欣賞一番。總而言之，本章非常符合「the Fate of Europe」的副標題，但 Stalin 含量不足。僅論史料運用和敘述水準，也是上佳的一章。</p>

<p>6. 波蘭工人黨領導人哥慕烏卡（Władysław Gomułka）與史達林的恩怨（1944–9）。這一章主要討論波蘭工人黨內部的路線闘爭。戰前史達林就很不喜歡偏向托洛茨基派（Trotskyism）的波蘭共產黨，並在 1938 年將大量波共領導人送進古拉格，因此二戰期間重組的波蘭工人黨多數都忠於史達林。老資格共產黨人哥慕烏卡偶然逃過了 1938 年大清洗，並在德國佔領波蘭時重回波蘭工人黨，但他深知，在戰爭期間史達林對波蘭也沒做什麼好事。史達林雖在工人黨中扶持同樣老資格的別盧特（Bolesław Bierut），但政治基礎深厚的哥慕烏卡威信仍一時無兩，他實幹的風格也與史達林實用主義的波蘭政策很接近。但哥慕烏卡還是民族主義者。他發展出了一套所謂「通往社會主義的波蘭路線」：他希望讓波蘭人用波蘭的方法做事，而非唯莫斯科馬首是瞻；他像標準的波蘭民族主義者那樣反對猶太人在波蘭工人黨中佔據重要地位，即使這些人多是史達林的親信；他用民族主義式的宣傳提升工人黨的公信力，這在共產國際和正統派共產黨人之中引發爭議；他在蘇南衝突中始終希望做和事佬，引發史達林和親蘇派的不滿。最終導致他被罷黜的是 1948 年他對猶太共產主義的批評：史達林在此時雖然已經開始警惕東歐共產黨中的猶太人，但也不願看到波蘭工人黨中佔比很大的親蘇猶太領導人被哥慕烏卡迅速打敗。而哥慕烏卡過早公開了這場矛盾，這就逼着史達林站在他的對立面：8–9 月，隨着別盧特訪蘇，對哥慕烏卡的總清算開始了。他被貼上「民族主義」「右傾」「獨裁」「在宗派主義與極端機會主義間反覆」等罪名，但因他在波蘭的威望和非猶太人身份，史達林不便直接處死他，而試圖說服他改弦更張，服從工人黨的親蘇路線；同時以同樣的罪名審判清洗他的親信。見哥慕烏卡不屈服，親史達林的別盧特下令逮捕了他，雖仍礙於他的地位而未審判或處死他，但還是將他軟禁在家，直至三年半後纔釋放。</p>

<p>本章細節豐富，正文全在利用蘇聯和波蘭的回憶錄、檔案和公開文本梳理史事，並在敘述中牽涉戰前波蘭共產黨、共產國際大會等其他相關史事。到結語，奈馬克纔提出了嚴肅的問題：爲什麼哥慕烏卡在清洗中倖存，而波蘭工人黨在史達林死後又如何逐漸走回了哥慕烏卡的道路，直到哥慕烏卡於 1956 年重回政治舞臺。他試圖呈現，即使在被蘇聯牢牢拴住的波蘭，當地共產黨人也可戴着鐐銬有限度地挑戰莫斯科的利益。這樣的題目正如奈馬克本人所說，在南斯拉夫體現得最爲明顯。而波蘭則是問題繁多，但每一個問題都無法單獨討論。總之。本章大體可說是優秀的歷史敘事，但略顯零散。</p>

<p>7. 戰後奧地利的主權獨立（1944–9）。奧地利雖然被認定是「納粹的第一個受害國」但戰後卻像德國一樣被四大國分別佔領。史達林在奧地利有多級目標：最好能讓奧地利變成「人民民主」的東歐式國家，一定不能讓奧地利直接倒向西方陣營，並必須保證蘇聯能在奧地利穩定駐軍至少一段時間以維持其在羅馬尼亞和匈牙利駐軍。史達林頗有頭腦地搬請德高望重的左翼領袖勒納（Karl Renner）領導一個有中右翼參與但整體左傾的臨時政府，很快維持住了奧地利政局並得到西方承認。但蘇軍在奧糟糕的軍紀，加之 1945 年國會選舉共產黨表現不利，都讓史達林很快放棄了將奧地利拉入東方陣營的想法，轉而控制奧地利蘇佔區的石油、火車工業等經濟部門，以便恢復東歐經濟和加強蘇聯在奧的硬實力。但奧地利戰後數年的選舉中，不僅共產黨始終無法得到 6% 的選篇，甚至前納粹成員都得到更多的票數，這也說明奧地利民衆在戰後的政治傾向，與美英和蘇聯的考慮均不相同。美英均希望迅速從奧地利撤軍，蘇聯也開始逐漸不關注奧地利，但蘇聯控制的奧地利經濟部門、奧地利「去納粹化」進程不順、法國和蘇聯要求的賠款問題等，都延緩了和平條約的簽訂。1948 年以後東歐倒向蘇聯，讓美國國防部更不願撤出奧地利，與美國外交部產生矛盾；蘇聯則害怕從奧地利撤軍後，已經撕破臉皮的南斯拉夫會乘機威脅有蘇聯駐軍的匈牙利和羅馬尼亞；斯大林死後，赫魯曉夫和莫洛托夫在奧地利問題上又意見相左。這場談判桌上的拉鋸戰最終到 1955 年纔告結束，剛剛建立的華沙公約組織讓蘇聯有理由常駐羅馬尼亞和匈牙利，而新的奧地利總理又對蘇聯讓步，並許諾本國的永久中立。奧地利最終得以在永久中立的基礎上結束十年佔領期。</p>

<p>本章並不好讀，雖然德文檔案材料豐富，但因爲史達林並不太重視奧地利，奈馬克使用的大量俄文材料都來自赫魯曉夫時代，其中意識形態的變化是否帶來記載上的偏差，奈馬克沒有提醒讀者注意。作者成功傳達了自己的觀點：奧地利的命運似乎一面因本國民衆的多次大選而很早敲定，另一方面又因爲美蘇內部的政治路線闘爭久久懸而未決。但或許是因爲意大利、柏林和波蘭三章珠玉在前，這個敘事略顯混亂，分析問題也淺嚐輒止的章節就顯得平淡了。</p>

<hr />

<p>我花費大量篇幅逐章討論的目的之一在於呈現本書的一大問題：各個案例研究的聯繫不足。這可能是所有以案例研究爲方法的歷史研究的宿命，但也一定程度上受限於作者的選例。他有意選取了一些在美國讀者看來並不那麼熟悉的國家和時期，這當然有助於賣書、讓作者相對方便地避開學術爭論最激烈的領域而投入自己的研究，但也讓這些國際性並不太強的案例（尤其是前三章）彼此間的聯繫並不那麼清楚。讀者可以看到蘇聯和南斯拉夫的衝突在阿爾巴尼亞、意大利、奧地利和波蘭事件的背後都起到了一定作用；但受限於作者對一些當地史料使用不足，我們並不太容易看到這些國家如何理解、適應和主動利用「國際大環境」來爲自己謀利（霍查除外）。</p>

<p>另一個令我不安的問題在於本書的主角史達林。在奈馬克的理解中，史達林外交政策並非全然理性、一貫，也不成系統。同時，即使是英法以外的其他歐洲各國，其內部的各方勢力也並非唯美蘇之一馬首是瞻。奈馬克試圖塑造這樣的史達林形象：他並不像傳統美國敘述中那樣，努力要把蘇聯模式推得越遠越好；他對不少東歐共產黨人並無好感，也在一些共產黨內部「踩一捧一」；他雖然不怕對抗，但在（他認爲）無意義的對抗上也不吝讓步。這個形象大體成立了，但在各章具體敘述中，史達林似乎更像是在每處要衝下小棋，而不是在下大棋：在給霍查回信時，他似乎並沒有關注同一時期的意大利；在威脅哥慕烏卡的同時，似乎柏林和維也納並不在他的視野中。這可能也是因爲作者使用的史料來源相對著重於個案。奈馬克在序言中曾指出，莫洛托夫等人的聲音背後都有著史達林的影子；但他在具體行文時，有時會直接把莫洛托夫、日丹諾夫等人的觀點拿來當作史達林的意見（如芬蘭一章），這也在一定程度上把本書副標題的「史達林」變成了「莫斯科」。在這點上，奧地利的部分因爲有著史達林和赫魯曉夫路線的不同，反而讓我們更清楚看到哪些是史達林的意見，哪些是蘇聯上層的共識。</p>

<p>這兩個大問題背後都是史料問題。考慮到本書終歸並非是專門個案的深入討論，而更像是一種半學術半普及的作品，我並不期待作者在非本人專精領域（德語、俄語世界）外給出什麼突破性的成果。奈馬克在自己能讀懂一手史料的四章中整體做得很好，而在丹麥、阿爾巴尼亞和芬蘭三例上則很明顯受到語言限制，史料集中在少數翻譯成其他語言的文集裏。在這種情況下，我期待奈馬克在序言就自我剖白，承認自己在選取史料的層面受什麼樣的侷限，而不是讓有心爬梳尾注的無聊讀者（比如我）發現後再來檢討問題。這再次提醒我等學史者，語言始終是研究任何問題上不能短缺的一塊木板。</p>

<p>奈馬克的大結語有很強的當代政治指向：他討論了歐盟對當下俄羅斯佔領克里米亞的反應，並認爲歐盟領導人的措施太軟。似乎他在用本書告訴歐洲人，「你們的先人面對不可一世的史達林都能爭得不同程度的自由空間。」對這種政治指向，還請各位讀者自行考量。</p>

<hr />

<p>我會向所有非冷戰史專業的朋友推薦本書。這本書至少在一點上非常成功：奈馬克成功讓讀者認清，那些事後看來再不可避免、趨勢再明顯不過的事件，其發生之前都可能有多種可能性，其演進的過程都非常複雜。當下的歷史學者，不敢說每個人都會努力擁抱和鍾愛這種複雜性，但至少都不會排斥之。</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="reading" /><category term="reading" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Book review]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">米利都与赫拉克莱亚的「同公民权」合约</title><link href="https://wangbanban17.github.io//blog/2023/milet/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="米利都与赫拉克莱亚的「同公民权」合约" /><published>2023-02-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-02-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://wangbanban17.github.io//blog/2023/Milet</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://wangbanban17.github.io//blog/2023/milet/"><![CDATA[<h1 id="米利都与赫拉克莱亚的同公民权合约">米利都与赫拉克莱亚的「同公民权」合约</h1>

<p>公元前 2 世纪上半叶的小亚细亚政治形势非常复杂，实力强大的城邦已不满足于仅控制本城及周边的土地，而是通过军事同盟、合邦（<em>sympoliteia</em>）等多种外交和军事手段吞并小城邦或将中小城邦收拢于自己的势力范围之内。
尤其在小亚细亚的地中海沿岸一线，随着罗马于公元前 191—190 年联合当地盟友大胜东方的塞琉古王安条克三世（Antiochos III），罗马的两个盟友别迦摩（Pergamon）和罗德斯（Rhodos）大致以迈安德罗斯河（Maiandros，今土耳其中部大门德雷斯河[Büyük Menderes Nahri]）为界，河北归别迦摩控制，河南属罗德斯。</p>

<p>Early Roman inscriptions contextualised in the Hellenistic sanctuary of Apollo Pythios</p>

<p>A talk for the workshop <a href="https://anchoringinnovation.nl/events/workshop-anchoring-innovation-in-delphi">Anchoring Innovation in Delphi</a>, at Universiteit Utrecht.</p>

<hr />

<p>This is the first in-person academic conference I’ve participated in during the COVID times, and the last country I visited before the pandemic was the Netherlands. The last time I was at Utrecht Centraal, my German sounded like Dutch; and now, my Dutch bears a strong German accent. The pandemic has changed our world so much that everyone is anxious to find new stabilities and rules for living, but the old anchors may need serious reconsiderations.</p>

<p>So much for contemporary issues and now let’s scale back twenty three centuries, towards the early second century before the Christian era, another time period when great changes took place.</p>

<p>Entrance and Involvement of the Romans in the Eastern Mediterranean Area gave birth to “a change for a millenium” which permanently transformed the area. The main playground of our workshop, Delphi, was definitely a crucial space within this transformation. All the major changes brought by the external powers tend to bring materialisation of new power, structure and newly constructed memory in this space, which witnessed all kinds of physical testimonies to previous glories. Romans were, perhaps, just a new dominant power initially, and only later did the Delphians know the dominance would last long. This presentation brings ideas on how the new power, the Romans took the Hellenistic sanctuary and injected their practice in this Greek landmark.</p>

<h2 id="start-with-a-statue">Start with a statue</h2>

<p>Let’s start with perhaps the most famous Roman monument in Delphi, the pillar of Aemilius Paulus, located at the front terrace of the Apollo temple. According to Plutarch, in -168 after his victory against Perseus in Pydna, L. Aemilius Paulus visited Delphi and saw a rectangular grand pillar in white marble, on which a golden statue of Perseus was to be placed. Paulus »gave orders that his own statue should be set there, for it was proper that the conquered should make room for their conquerors.«<d-footnote>Plut. Aem. 28.4. Polybius said there were multiple monuments, but archaeologists during the Grande Fouille only identified one monument that could be Paulus’s.</d-footnote></p>

<p>The pillar was divided into three parts: an orthostatic base, the shaft of the pillar with rosette decorations, and the entablature with an architrave, a frieze, and a cornice. While in Plutarch’s words we may assume the upper parts were later taken down with a new statue, archaeologists have found no trace for that: there was, according to multiple archaeologists, never a frieze for Perseus, and we see clear unity of execution between the shaft and the entablature.<d-footnote>Jacquemin &amp; Laroche 1982, 210 stands still here. </d-footnote> It’s thus safe to say, that the majority of the pillar was made with Roman themes. But there are in fact at least four pillars in similar shapes standing in this crowded area, and decorations like rosettes were also not unknown on other pillars. A contemporary visitor might say »Ehh, another pillar« when facing it.</p>

<p>The orthostatic base and its inscription pose questions beyond philology. Claude Vatin and earlier archaeologists all mention that »it’s certain that a Greek inscription existed before the Latin text«, though very difficult to decipher. While I think it goes too far to suggest that what Paulus saw was only this base, it is a fact that this base was reused from a Greek offering and the offering must have been massive given its size, likely to be royal: after all, to reuse something as a massive monument, you need a large original. We know many cases of reuse, but this is definitely the largest. The Latin text is also unusual from a classical perspective: as Apollo was not mentioned, it was not a »dedicatory text« in strict sense. But other Delphic pillars nearby also normally have no dedications, in contrast, they usually have honorific inscriptions at the most visible part of the shaft. Here, the Latin text only says that the consul »took from King Perseus and Macedonians«. The object, though omitted, is obvious, as long as THE AUDIENCE READS LATIN. As of now, the most convincing proposal about the pillar is, for me, that its base was captured and the upper parts were added subsequently following surrounding examples; but there are also new elements: the new language inaccessible to local visitors, large-scale reuse, and a frieze with lavish decorations.</p>

<h2 id="statements">Statements</h2>

<p>The pillar of Aemilius Paulus shows multiple layers of phenomena that I’d like to discuss in today’s talk. It was a reused monument, and the original scale enabled the reuse. It was erected in an area full of similar objects, reinforcing the monumental landscape of the terrace in front of the temple. And as I will discuss later, it would eventually be used following a Delphic pattern of reusing old monuments to carry later inscriptions of various nature. On the levels of monument, landscape and practice, we see clear similarities between this pillar and other dedications in the Hellenistic sanctuary of Apollo, but also new elements that were never seen in earlier times.</p>

<p>This links to the main topic of our workshop, the practice of anchoring with previous existing objects and patterns of practice. »When in Delphi, do as what other people did here«. I appropriate the proverb to describe the Roman practice in its earlier stage. As Ineke Sluiter mentioned in the founding essay of the project, imitation and appropriation play a key role in the anchoring innovation as it facilitates the understanding and usage of the new by putting it in old frameworks.</p>

<p>But in contrast with previous dominant powers like the Macedonians and the Aitolians, the coming of the Romans was met with more active responses from the Delphians, who were both actively exploiting the Roman influence in order to get rid of the Aitolian dominance, and fearing the political instability and the potential disasters as many anti-Roman Greek powers, Perseus included, also tried to benefit from the prestige of Apollo Pythios’ sanctuary. Therefore, the early second century before Christ witnessed not consecutive impositions of Roman monuments, but a mutual honour-favour system. In this way, I hope to render more agency to the Delphians and the Amphictiony when proper. Notice, in this period Delphi also underwent significant Athenian and Pergamene influence, topics that I’ll discuss in other chapters of my dissertation but not here.</p>

<h2 id="three-levels-of-anchoring">Three levels of anchoring</h2>

<p>The transformation of the sanctuary’s landscape can be understood in three levels, as the two parts we have already seen from the Pillar.</p>

<p>First, monuments that existed prior to the coming of the Romans were re-used, at various scales, for Roman purposes. This, I repeat, was not exclusively done by the Romans, but in many cases by locals and by the erectors of the monument.</p>

<p>Second, erection of monuments for Roman purposes changes the surrounding landscape, but at the same time should adhere to the previous look and could not be too out-of-context.</p>

<p>Third, the practice of erecting monuments for Roman purposes largely follows earlier Hellenistic practice, that is, keeping monuments at the most prominent space open to further texts, but to a certain extent related to Romans.</p>

<p>Now I’d like to expand the three points with selected examples. Notice, that while we have 24 monuments that were related to the Romans in the period -190 to -31, only a few can be securely located or found <em>in situ</em>. Like the pillar, what we know are usually its contemporary form, and the area to which it would have been erected. Therefore, a very detailed visual tour is, while very charming, infeasible. Even so, certain interpretations could be made on a not-so-micro-level. I would also like to hear from you whether you think my interpretations are too wild.</p>

<h2 id="monuments-reused-for-roman-purposes">Monuments reused for Roman purposes</h2>

<p>First, about reused monuments for Romans.</p>

<p>We are talking about two kinds of reuse: the first is complete capture and repurposing, as we saw in the case of Paulus’s pillar.</p>

<p>According to Dominika Grzesik’s painstaking calculations, there were 24 statues for Roman officials mentioned in literary and epigraphic sources during the period between -190 and -31, but we found only 15 that could be traced on stone, and in two cases we know from proxenia decrees that there would have been a statue somewhere, only not found.</p>

<p>At least in three cases were material taken from other monuments, its original text erased in order to bear new Roman texts: notice that there were only six confirmed cases in Delphi for the entire Hellenistic period, so to some extent such Roman reuse is neither too banal nor too innovative. In all the three cases, the size of the original block is decisive to the size of the new staute. An orthostatic base from the famous ex-voto of Daochos was taken from the Thessalian treasury to the south of the sacred way, and a Latin dedication was inscribed under the name of Q. Minucius Rufus the legatus in -107. Notice that the Latin ligature »Ph« and the »V« in place for »Y«, both symbolising a certain Greekness in the process of inscribing a text foreign to Delphi. The base would later be further reused by a proxenia decree for a Leukios Tillios or Lucius Tullius (<em>SGDI</em> II 2688) at least twenty years later (a better date could be expected when <em>CID</em> 5.2 is published, fingers crossed.). Then, the Delphians would clearly have a say over the statue for the Roman legatus, as an abbreviated decree for L. Tullius L. f. fits well on a statue for a Roman official.</p>

<p>The second kind of reuse is to take an available space while not changing its original purposes. What stays in my mind is that some documents rendering Roman authority were inscribed on important buildings or dedications within the sanctuary. The original meaning of the building, therefore, is crucial to the disposition of the new text. A very visible case is the <em>senatus Consultum</em> arbitrating the dispute between Athenian and Isthmian dionysiac artists (<em>FD</em> III 2.70). The long <em>SC</em> in -112 was in favour of the Athenians, so the latter naturally inscribed the long text onto their most prominent offering in Delphi, the Athenian treasury, at the very low level of the western side, namely very close to visitors climbing up.</p>

<p>Writing new documents on old monuments is a common secondary usage of Delphic monuments as many of large offerings offer perfect blanks in marble. Among all the 7 available Roman documents in Delphi, six were written on existing monuments (one on the Athenian treasury, two on the Paulus’ pillar, one on the orthostate of the temple), and two of them were even written on the same one, namely the honorific statue of M’ Acilius Glabrio. After the Delphians dedicated the equestrian statue to the Roman consul in -191, a letter from him to the city giving A long list of properties to the Delphians was inscribed right below the dedication, and its author was not named, suggesting that a careful reader would know who the author is. A year later, consul Livius Salinator wrote another letter about the assassination of Delphian embassy, which was inscribed alongside the previous letter. This time we do know the author and the topic both changed, but the authority of the Roman documents had already been materialised in the statue of the grand benefactor and imperator. As the two letters dealt with similar issues, it is reasonable to understand why the Delphian authorities chose to shorten Salinator’s letter and inscribe it onto the statue.</p>

<p>In short, for existing monuments, the anchor is clear: as the original location, size, and purpose were still known to many, especially to the Delphians, the reuse normally did not depart much from the original. In the case of the pillar, we see a strong political message conveyed in the practice of total capture and repurposing. The usage of the Latin texts also shows clearly visible Roman presence in the sanctuary, in contrast to the largely Greek landscape.</p>

<h2 id="landscape-a-gradual-change">Landscape: a gradual change</h2>

<p>Talking about the landscape, we observe a gradual change in the period between -190 and -31. In the late third century and the early second century BCE, the <em>epiphanestatos topoi</em> (most visible spaces) in Delphi are (1) the front terrace of the temple, where many of the large dedications from Hellenistic kings were found, following the famous serpent column celebrating the defeat of the Persians; (2) the <em>halos</em> in front of the Portico of the Athenians, where many ritual processions started or ended. Romans and Delphians all know that the disposition of offerings display a mini „politics of space“, so we see when Romans erected their dedications or when the Delphians dedicated statues for Roman officials, the statues were normally found at the aforementioned two areas. Among the 10 Roman monuments we found <em>in situ</em>, four were at the <em>halos</em> and six were at the temple terrace.</p>

<p>Especially important is the temple terrace, because the pillar, which could be seen later as the Roman <em>monument à souvenir</em>. All the monuments found at the <em>halos</em> predated the pillar, that’s to say, after Pydna, the Delphians dedicated statues for Roman officials only on the temple terrace. Only Eumenes II king of Pergamon and Prusias king of Bithynia have such prestige in the second century. Also, 48% of the Delphic dedications were made for Romans, making the temple terrace almost a space for the Romans. The practice was clearly understood by both Sulla and all the later Roman emperors, as dedications for Roman emperors in the Imperial time were almost all found on the terrace. Interestingly, such a clear transformation of the <em>epiphanestatos topos</em> did not happen in Olympia, as the Romans after the conquest of Achaia largely belittled Zeus’s sanctuary for a long time and only offered a small number of dedications there. The process only happens in the Imperial period, much later than the change in Delphi.</p>

<h3 id="praxeology">Praxeology</h3>

<p>Up to now, one may assume that the Romans and the Delphians all took great care of Roman monuments, as for the Delphians keeping them in good order can help them maintain a good relationship with the western dominant power. But this is somehow not true: like all the other monuments dedicated in Delphi, Roman ones were also open and Delphic authorities (the city and the Amphictiony) still held right to write other documents on them.</p>

<p>Let’s go back to the pillar. Archaeologists identified in total 39 texts on the pillar. You may have already noticed that below and above the Latin text for Paulus, we have Greek texts written later. The Delphians did put seven proxenia decrees for Romans on the pillar: this may be a deliberate choice by the honoured Romans, as two of the texts mentioned. In contrast to similar pillars like that of the Messenians or of Prusias, Paulus’s pillar has higher percentage of proxenia decrees for the honorand’s „compatriots“.</p>

<p>But we should not forget that the pillar was by nature a large white marble at the most visible space of the great sanctuary. Thus, when the Delphians felt the need to emphasise a crucial text or when someone wants his/her proxenia to be at a wonderful place, Paulus’ pillar is a good choice. On the orthostate base of the pillar to the left side, we find four long Amphictionic decrees solving a dispute between two neighbouring communities, Skarpheon and Thronion. The Athenians who oversaw the arbitration took great care of the issue and ordered the arbitration texts to be inscribed in the sanctuary. As an ally of the Romans, they may get permissions from the Romans or may think it’s no problem. Further in the last century BCE, 15 proxenia decrees for the Greeks were inscribed on the pillar: some were honoured because they served as ambassadors to Rome, but others have nothing to do with Rome. Moreover, we even find four manumission acts, and no link with Rome can be found.</p>

<p>The fact that these texts could be inscribed on the prominent pillar could only be understood within the common practice in this period. No monument in this period is »reserved« for a certain community, as the booming epigraphic practice boosted the demand of space for writing. Where there is a blank, there might be an inscription. At the same time, small texts like proxenia decrees and manumission acts tend to spread from the south to the north of the sanctuary: in mid-second century BCE, when most of the lower monuments near the entrance were almost full of texts, such texts start to appear on monuments on the temple terrace. The trend continued into early Imperial period, when such small texts occupied the previously uninscribed Northern theatre area.</p>

<p>Given the background of space usage in this period, we can say that the Roman monuments function as an integral part of the sanctuary and did not receive too much exceptional treatment. The Romans, who cared much about the erection of those monuments, did not exclude others from using their space: after all, »When in Delphi, do as what other people did here« may work during the entire life of a monument.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>»Connecting the new to the familiar«, the motto of the project Anchoring Innovation speaks a lot when I come to observe those early dedications by or for the Romans. Especially in Delphi where so many written and unwritten rules were familiar to local Delphians and the Amphictionians, it is important not only for the Romans but also for our later epigraphists to detect those rules, in order not to offer wayward and out-of-context interpretations.</p>

<p>In the classical period, Delphi was not dominated by any single power; in the Hellenistic time, the sanctuary was familiar with changing powers from the Macedonians to the Aitolians, from Pergamon to Athens. It is in the Roman period that we see a total dominance of imperial symbols and dedications. But I find it important to describe the change of such mechanisms, not only as a game of power display, but also a game of honour in exchange for favour. This will be a larger story to tell.
