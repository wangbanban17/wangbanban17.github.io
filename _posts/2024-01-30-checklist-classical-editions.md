# Optionally, you can add a table of contents to your post.
# NOTES:
#   - make sure that TOC names match the actual section names
#     for hyperlinks within the post to work correctly.
#   - we may want to automate TOC generation in the future using
#     jekyll-toc plugin (https://github.com/toshimaru/jekyll-toc).

# Notice

This is a work-in-progress checklist of available editions for certain classical works.
It is primarily for my personal use so there is a larger focus on sources I'm interested in, but feel free to use it and to help me add it in better form.
For books in several volumes, I give data in volume.

I understand the concept of editions in two ways, both in terms of philologically critical editions and in appropriate translated versions into modern languages.
I follow the abbreviations in *Der neue Pauly*.
