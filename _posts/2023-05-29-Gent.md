## Introduction

Goedemorgen !
It's my great pleasure to come back to Gent and also to participate in this great workshop, meet some old friends and talk about late antiquity.
I thank [Lieve](https://research.flw.ugent.be/en/lieve.vanhoof), [Marijke](https://research.flw.ugent.be/en/marijke.kooijman) and [Matthijs](https://research.flw.ugent.be/en/matthijs.zoeter) for the organisation and it's so nice to meet you all, especially after the tough COVID time which we all went through.
My talk today is a preliminary attempt to bring some methods from earlier periods and different areas to late antique epigraphy, especially Greek epigraphy.
At the same time, I hope to see what a *longue durée* perspective on late-antique public documents can help us understand civic mechanism in Greek cities, especially larger cities in developing a landscape of inscriptions.

## Epigraphic Landscape

Many Hellenistic and Roman cities in the Hellenophone were covered with a textile full of inscriptions.
While epigraphic practice declined to a certain extent starting from the third century onwards, the presence of inscriptions are still everywhere in late antique cities, even though new public texts were mostly found in large metropoleis.
It is against this background that epigraphers in the last decades talked more, in an archaeological glance, on the concept of *epigraphic landscape*.<d-footnote>On this topic, a good glance on the research stand is Ruiz (2013) on Roman epigraphy.<d-cite key="ruiz2013Paisaje"/> In the Hellenophone, see Lasagni and Tropea (2019) and their research project [Epigraphic Landscape of Athens](http://epigraphiclandscape.unito.it/index.php).<d-cite key="lasagniTropea2019Paesaggio"/></d-footnote>
The seemingly broad concept is roughly defined here as:

> part of a phenomenological system or an artistic installation, in which actors can only engage with inscribed artefacts that set up boundaries to limit and passes to enable movements and interactions.

Studies on the epigraphic landscape focus much on cities with a rich monumental and epigraphic presence: Athens, many well-excavated cities in the Latinophone west, Rome, and my dissertation on Hellenistic Delphi.
Such studies take a diachronic view of inscribing practice and examine how viewers in their own times could view, understand, and interact with inscribed artefacts (walls, steles, etc.) within its environments.

It is important to ask the question how viewers saw inscribed documents, both those inscribed in their time and in earlier times, as part of the city landscape.
To answer this question, we need to identify both the nature of the inscription-bearers (*Schriftträger*) and the view in a given time, in our case, late antiquity, in order to give proper interpretations.
Unfortunately, archaeological evidence is less well preserved than earlier times, partly because of the frequent reuse of monumental and architectural blocks.

## Ephesos: cumulative texts in a changing landscape

Thanks both to its metropolitan status in *Provincia Asiae* and to the long and detailed excavations, Ephesos was an unescapable case on any serious discussion about public epigraphy in the late antique East, just like Delphi in the Hellenistic times.

Inscribed administrative letters in Ephesos are found in many places in the city.

## Aphrodisias: old texts in new landscape



## Dealing with old inscribed letters?

Reinterpretation of old inscribed administrative documents influenced the reusing process of temples and constructions in the late-antique period. (Anna PhD Chapter 3)


## Concluding Remarks



Thank you for your attention, and I'm looking forward to your questions, vos remarques, und Ihre Anmerkungen.
