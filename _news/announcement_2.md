The **Seminar für Alte Geschichte und Epigraphik** at Heidelberg is in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.atticinscriptions.com"><i>Attic Inscription Online</i></a>, contributing to the online database with selected Attic inscriptions found in Delphi. A preparatory workshop is held on 03 August 2022.

I present on various name lists of the second Pythaïs, inscribed on the Athenian Treasury. 

The project aims to transfer knowledge of epigraphic sources in antiquity to lay readers without Greek knowledge. In comparison with the relatively traditional German style of academic production, this British project requires more delicate thoughts and considerations on the audience. It is a challenge to find a balance between the complexity of academic research and the clarity of expression aiming at wider audience.
