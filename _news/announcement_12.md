My contributions to the project [Attic Inscriptions in Delphi](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/fakultaeten/philosophie/zaw/sag/sag_aid.html) have finally been online! Go read the documents concerning the second [Pythaïs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythaids) on [Attic Inscriptions Online](https://www.atticinscriptions.com/browse/bypublicationdate/2023-12-03) among contributions from my colleagues!
