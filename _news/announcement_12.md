My contributions to the [Attic Inscriptions Online](https://www.atticinscriptions.com/browse/bypublicationdate/2023-12-03/) are finally online! I write commentaries on the documents of the [Pytha√Øs procession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythaids) from Athens to Delphi in 128/7 BCE, on the famous [Athenian Treasury at Delphi](https://arachne.dainst.org/entity/5593).
