During my healthcare year in 2016-2017 I undertook the assignment for translating G. Woolf's profound research companion into Simplified Chinese. It was not until 2022 when the CN-S version finally comes out. 

There are some topics that I have been thinking during the translating process. I am moving some of the posts from my [Douban](https://www.douban.com/people/Charles-Canton/) to this blog.

In some cases, the content is censored during the editorial process, and I will list them here.

Interestingly, the editorial process took so long that Greg has revised the book and published the second version.
