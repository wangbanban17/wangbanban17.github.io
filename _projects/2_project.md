Together with the [Attic Inscriptions Online](https://www.atticinscriptions.com), our [Seminar für Alte Geschichte und Epigraphik](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/fakultaeten/philosophie/zaw/sag/) at Heidelberg gather a group of PhD candidates and students to provide a collection of inscriptions on Athenian presence at the sanctuary of Apollo Pythios at Delphi.

I contribute to this project with seven entries, all about the Athenian *Pythaïs* procession to Delphi and all found on the façades of the [Athenian Treasury](https://arachne.dainst.org/entity/5593).
They were located according to the sketch below.

I also designed this logo on the basis of my sketch for the east face of the Athenian Treasury.

The first [*ouvrage*](https://atticinscriptions.com/browse/bypublicationdate/2023-6-5/) has been online since 05.06.2023.

The texts I work on will be published on 31.07.2023! I'll add a link to all my works here at that time.
